# Ballroom

Ballroom is a site concept for a music news portal, developed by [Erick Jansen](https://github.com/Ey-Jay) and [Joss Doebler](https://github.com/jossdoe). 

The master-branch uses React on the frontend, the more recently developed auditorium-branch also features a Next.js-version of the same site. On the backend, we use Contentful via GraphQL for most parts of the site, and our own GraphQL-API [backstage](https://github.com/Ey-Jay/backstage) for the rest (only in the Next.js version).

You can take a look the deployed App (auditorium-branch) here: https://ballroom.vercel.app/
